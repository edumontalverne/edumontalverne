I'm a Software Engineering student and I'm also studying Fullstack Development and Quality Assurance in Software Development.

But my professional journey began long before the world of Info Tech. I've spent most of my life as a chemist, either as a high school teacher or as a brewer in craft beer industries.
In my last job, I was the brewery's Beer Production Supervisor, responsible for brewing, bottling and ensuring the quality of beer production.

Then I decided to change direction when I realized that the world is evolving through technology and I wanted to be a part of it.
